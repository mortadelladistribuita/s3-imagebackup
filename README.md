# s3-imagebackup
I'm a salesman of distributed S3 compatible object storage. I wanted to store my personal pictures somewhere safe where I would be able to view my photos in a while, without using Google Drive. The code was written with Python GPT, as I have no coding experience, although I have a basic understanding of S3 object storage APIs.
